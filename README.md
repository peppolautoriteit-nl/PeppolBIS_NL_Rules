# Peppol BIS 3 Country-specific Rules for NL Draft

This repository contains the specification and rationale for the 
country-specific rules for the Netherlands to Peppol BIS 3.

These rules have been added to Peppol BIS 3 in the 2021 Fall release.

# Validation

The draft version of this repository also contained work-in-progress validation files. Now that the rules have been added to Peppol BIS 3 (in the 2021 Fall release), this repository no longer needs to contain these validation rules. You can find the validation files for Peppol BIS 3 [here](https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/)
